Count with Python
These are introductory exercises in Python for fundamental mathematics. It is important to both know mathematics as well as Python in order to understand machine learning concepts. Also a focus here is to use Python as a tool for solving mathematical problems.

Remember to use variables in your computations

Remember to format your answers in a neat way using f-strings

The number of stars (*), (**), (***) denotes the difficulty level of the task

1. Pythagorean theorem (*)
  a)   A right angled triangle has the catheti: a = 3 and b = 4 length units. Compute the hypothenuse of the triangle. (*)

  b)   A right angled triangle has hypothenuse c = 7.0 and a cathetus a = 5.0 length units. Compute the other cathetus and round to one decimal. (*)



Hint
Video lecture (swedish)

To do square root in Python

import math
math.sqrt()

Answer a)
The hypothenuse is 5 length units
b)

The other cathetus is 4.9 length units
2. Classification accuracy (*)
A machine learning algorithm has been trained to predict whether or not it would rain the next day. Out of 365 predictions, it got 300 correct, compute the accuracy of this model.

3. Classification accuracy (*)
A machine learning model has been trained to detect fire. Here is the result of its predictions:

True Positive (TP)
Reality: fire
Predicted: fire
Number of TP: 2
False Positive (FP)
Reality: no fire
Predicted: fire
Number of FP: 2
False Negative (FN)
Reality: fire
Predicted: no fire
Number of FN: 11
True Negative (TN)
Reality: no fire
Predicted: no fire
Number of TN: 985
Calculated the accuracy using the following formula:

 

Is this a good model?

Hint
Try to understand what it means for the actual user with each category


Answer
The accuracy of this model is 0.987.
4. Line (*)
Compute the slope 
 and the constant term 
 of this line using the points 
 and 
.



Hint
 
 

Either plug in one point into 
 and solve for 
 or read the intersection with y-axis in the graph.

Solution
k = 0.75, m = 1, so the equation for the slope is y = 0.75x + 1
5. Euclidean distance (*)
The Euclideam distance between the points 
 and 
 is the length of a line between them. Let 
 and 
 and compute the distance between them.

Hint The formula is:

Answer
The distance is around 5.1 length units.
6. Euclidean distance in 3D (**)
Calculate the distance between the points 
 and 

Hint
Let 
 and 

, where 
 is the Euclidean distance between 
 and 


Answer
The distance is around 4.12 l.u.
